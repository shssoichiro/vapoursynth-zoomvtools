/// Performs horizontal bicubic interpolation for sub-pixel motion estimation refinement.
///
/// This function applies bicubic interpolation horizontally to create sub-pixel samples
/// between existing pixels. Bicubic interpolation uses a 4-tap kernel that considers
/// 4 horizontal neighbors, providing smooth and high-quality interpolation suitable
/// for motion estimation with sub-pixel accuracy.
///
/// Edge pixels use simple averaging due to insufficient neighbors for the full kernel.
///
/// # Parameters
/// - `src`: Source image buffer
/// - `dest`: Destination buffer for interpolated results
/// - `pitch`: Number of pixels per row in both buffers
/// - `width`: Width of the image in pixels
/// - `height`: Height of the image in pixels
/// - `bits_per_sample`: Bit depth of the pixel format for clamping

/// Performs vertical bicubic interpolation for sub-pixel motion estimation refinement.
///
/// This function applies bicubic interpolation vertically to create sub-pixel samples
/// between existing pixels. Bicubic interpolation uses a 4-tap kernel that considers
/// 4 vertical neighbors, providing smooth and high-quality interpolation suitable
/// for motion estimation with sub-pixel accuracy.
///
/// Edge rows use simple averaging due to insufficient neighbors for the full kernel,
/// and the last row is copied directly from the source.
