/// Downscales an image by 2x using quadratic interpolation.
///
/// This function reduces both the width and height of the source image by half
/// using a two-pass quadratic filtering approach. First, vertical filtering is
/// applied to reduce the height, then horizontal filtering is applied in-place
/// to reduce the width. Quadratic interpolation provides a balance between
/// computational efficiency and image quality, using a 6-tap kernel with
/// quadratic weighting functions.
///
/// The quadratic filter uses different weights than cubic interpolation,
/// optimized for smooth gradients while maintaining sharpness in details.
///
/// # Parameters
/// - `dest`: Destination buffer to store the downscaled image
/// - `src`: Source image buffer to downscale
/// - `dest_pitch`: Number of pixels per row in the destination buffer
/// - `src_pitch`: Number of pixels per row in the source buffer
/// - `dest_width`: Width of the destination image (half of source width)
/// - `dest_height`: Height of the destination image (half of source height)
